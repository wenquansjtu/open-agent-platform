# Welcome to ForgeAI

ForgeAI is a citizen developer platform, allowing non-technical users to build, prototype, and use agents. These agents can be connected to a wide range of tools, RAG servers, and even other agents through an Agent Supervisor!

<Note>
This documentation is for the latest version of ForgeAI. If you're looking for the legacy documentation, you can find it [here](https://docs.oap.langchain.com).
